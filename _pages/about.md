I am a second-year Ph.D. student at the Image Processing Center of Beihang University, under the supervision of Professor [Fugen Zhou](http://www.sa.buaa.edu.cn/info/1148/11086.htm) and Associate Professor [Bo Liu](https://shi.buaa.edu.cn/liubo2/zh_CN/index/154719/list/index.htm). My research focuses on medical image analysis, automatic treatment planning for brachytherapy and tumor ablation, as well as the development of treatment planning systems (TPS).

### Treatment Planning System (TPS) Interface

I have also developed **Treatment Planning Systems (TPS)** for brachytherapy and tumor ablation, featuring modules for needle trajectory planning, dose optimization, and 3D visualization.
